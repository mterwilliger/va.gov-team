## Design Intent 3/20/2023

### Notes:
- Design: 
     - Caregiver facility should not be in an info-alert box
     - Consider card/tile without radio button
     - Choose Different facility should not be a CTA link
- Accessibility:
     - Disabled tile, not sure if there is a component for this. Disabled usually don't require color contrast requirements, however it is really lite colored - DESIGN Challenge!
     - Search results having radio buttons and paginations is an odd pattern, is there a way to not show pagination (show everything?)
     - Focus management - keep this in mind!
- IA:
     - Make it clearer as to why we are asking and why we need assoc CG site (Sitewide/IA/Accessibility to help with language)
     - H1 is lengthy, is there anything we can do to shorten it?
