## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauren and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about refilling prescriptions using the VA Health + Benefits mobile app.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


## Warm Up - 8 minutes
- What motivated you to download the VA health and benefits app?
- How long have you used it?
- What are the main things that you do in the app?

#### Optional (may need to cut for timing):
- How frequently do you use it? Daily, weekly, monthly?
- What do you like best? What do you wish you could change?


## General - 15 minutes
* What did you do the last time you had to fill a prescription?
    * Is this your first time using an app or website to order prescriptions? (ok to skip)
    * First time doing it with the VA Health + Benefits app? (ok to skip)
* Do you take any medications that you don’t get through VA? 
    * How do you manage those? 
* Are there meds that are not represented here that you still get through VA?
    * (feel out, ok to skip) What about things that aren’t pills?


#### Transition: Invite the participant to open the app and share screen


## Process - 15 minutes
Research moderator will mostly be in observation mode for this portion of the study. The moderator will invite the participant to speak aloud as they refill a prescription in the app. If the participant does not have an Active prescription to work with, they will walk through their recent experience refilling a prescription in the app. 

Once prompted by the participant, here are some questions:

* What important information do you need when requesting a refill?
    * Have you eer missed a indow to get a refill?
* Let's talk about what you’re seeing at the top of the screen. 
    * Have you ever used the ‘Filter by’ button? 
    * What do you think that means?
* Tap into **Filter by.** Reviewing the list on the screen, can you walk through each of the words and one by one, let me know what you think they mean?
* What do you expect to happen after you submit the request?


## List Detail - 5 minutes
* Is there anything missing or confusing here?
    * If so, what is it, and how would you get unstuck?


## Individual Prescription Detail - 3 minutes
* Can you describe what the dates listed here mean to you?
    * Fill date, Expires on, Ordered on


## Closing - 3 minutes
* Your feedback is an important step in our work on the app, and we appreciate your time today. Your voice matters! It helps us understand what you go through, so we can continue to improve the experience with these tools.
* Thank you!
